# CustomerSatisfactionAnalysisandPredictiveModeling
A vast majority of the economic model of airline companies is based upon their customer base. This dependence goes beyond just the direct fare revenue generated. Most of the profits this industry sees are in terms of the value of Air Miles travelled which relates to how well they retain/ expand their customer base. Like most services, customer satisfaction plays a significant role in the aviation industry. In this project, we will explore airlines customer satisfaction using machine learning algorithms. 
The data source for the following project has been taken from the open-source repository: Kaggle for which the link can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction?datasetId=522275&sortBy=voteCount. The data is in the format of an airlines survey stored as a comma separated value (.csv) file. It is a highly comprehensive data set with 25 attributes and 50k + observations. Some of the more relevant attributes present in the dataset are gender, customer type, age, type of travel, class, flight distance, ease of booking etc. In this project, our efforts will focus on finding out the most relevant attributes that help predict the customer satisfaction level. Broadly speaking, demographic and customer preference factors will be this project's focus.
